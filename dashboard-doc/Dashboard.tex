 \chapter*{Acknowledgments}
 \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgments}
First of all I would like to thank Silvia for the constant support and effort
she gave me to carry out this project.\\

I would also like to thank Juan Manuel and Roberto for the long
and constant support they gave me till the last moment. Something I really
appreciate and I am sure it is appreciated by their colleagues as well. \\

Last but not the least, I would really thank the open source community and the
constant work and initiatives that the online world that has boosting every day
new ways to do things and raise improvements for the 3rd needs. Without all this
people, this project could not be possible.
 

\chapter*{Source Code}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Source Code}
All code has been pushed to \url{https://github.com/beldog/dashboard}
repository, as well this document under \url{https://github.com/beldog/dashboard-doc} repository.

\chapter*{Motivation}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Motivation}
In order to track and follow up project's status, my colleagues and I
built, on 2013, a simple tool in a spreadsheet that linked with a database that
allowed us to log each change (aka \emph{event}) on the project status of on
the following scope: phase change end/start, delay, launch.

This tool also gave us a good view about different selected KPI \footnote{Key
Performance Indicator}. And based on those indicators some reports can be
built:
Project's events, Project's launched, Project's delayed (and detail), Project's
Gantt and Project's timelines.

The tool was fine for a while, but it took too much time to load all data
from the database, and also was not fully accessible for all users, because
of the need to install some extra required components like the ODBC for those with
Windows, or not even compatible with those using Linux computers, because the
tool was built on Microsoft Excel.

So, imagine trying to track project's \emph{events} on a tool that is slow
and not compatible with everybody. At the end we stopped using it.

Then, a fresh motivation came up to build something better,
usable for all required users and faster enough to aim the objective: track,
analyze and decide. 

The challenge was both there and as well the information on the database, so it
was just a matter to migrate the spreadsheet (the view) to a HTML page with some JS,
as first client, so we decouple it from any need of 3rd party component such as
ODBC, having in the middle a RESTful service that
controls the communication between the client (web browser) and what matters,
the data (our business).

\chapter*{Planning}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Planning}
Now that you know what is the main objective, next step is to break it down in
small parts and assign timelines.

Three different phases has been defined:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Phase 1: Migrate current spreadsheet dashboard to simple REST +
	HTML/JS
	\item Phase 2: Implement Dashboard view with HTLM5/CSS3/JS
	\item Phase 3: Automate dependencies linking Dashboard with 3rd ticketing
	tool
\end{itemize}

Moreover, this project was forecasted as 6 month project but extended on
the time to 9 months, because the time expected to be invested per day is less
than half working day top. So forecasted timelines were defined as follows:

\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
   	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{./resources/planning_baseline_12pt.png}
   	\caption{Planning Baseline}
   	\label{f_planning_baseline}
\end{figure}

Main process followed has been the \emph{Lean approach}, where we have
dedicated part of the time to get documented on new frameworks or APIs
that we could use in order to don't reinvent the wheel, and as soon as we
learned about the new technology, then we build a small piece of the final tool,
so we can see and check out how it performs and increase the complexity or
correct the issues later on, but with a working piece of the tool.

But life has always time for surprises and good presents, and mentioned
timelines were badly impacted because of two main reasons: \emph{I became a father} and
\emph{I was promoted at work}. Be a father is one of the most wonderful things
I have ever lived, but has its own downsides, like any plan that you
built before the birth gets automatically outdated. And this is what happened
with the plan shown above. So we ended with the following timelines: 

\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
   	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{./resources/planning_sep2014_12pt.png}
   	\caption{Final Timelines}
   	\label{f_planning_final}
\end{figure}

As you can see, Phase 1 has been delayed for almost 5 months. Of course those 5
months has not been 0\% investment, but the productivity on this period was
around 5\%.

Once Phase 1 was fineshed (middle June\/2014), a replanning was required, and
the output was to cancelled Phase 3 and leave it as future work.
