\part{Migrate Excel spreadsheet dashboard to a simple REST+HTML/JS
application}
\label{c_phaseone}

\chapter*{Motivation}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Motivation}
In order to track and follow up project's status, we built a simple tool in a
spreadsheet that linked with a database allowed us to log each change (aka
\emph{event}) on the project status on the following scope: phase change
end/start, delay, launch.

This tool also gave us a good view about different selected KPI \footnote{Key
Performance Indicator}. And based on those indicators we built few reports:
Project's events, Projects launched, Projects delayed (and detail), Projects
Gantt and Project's timelines.

The tool was fine for a while, but it took to much time to load all data
from the database, and also was not fully compatible with all users, because of
the need to install some extra required components like the ODBC for those with
Windows, or not even compatible with those using Linux computers, because the
tool was built on Microsoft Excel.

So, imagine trying to track project's \emph{events} on a tool that is slow
and not compatible with everybody. At the end we stopped using it.

Then, a fresh motivation came up to build something better,
usable for all required users and faster enough to aim the objective: track,
analyze and decide. 

The challenge was there and as well the information on the database, so it was
just a matter to migrate the spreadsheet (the view) to a HTML page with some JS,
as first client, so we decople it from any need of 3rd party component such as
ODBC, having in the middle a RESTful service that
controls the communication between the client (web browser) and what matters, the data (the model).

\chapter{Current Excel architecture}
At the beginning, the idea was to have the data centralized
\label{t_main_objective} and implement, in a fast way, a client that could show
it. The quicker solution, not always the right one but useful for a while, was
to define the simpliest database model to  track the maximum amount of events with enough value to evaluate a the
efficiency of a project and learn from our mistakes. Together with the database
we setup a Excel spreadsheet that loads the data from the defined database, but
we also needed to build different reports, so we difined few \emph{views} based
on the required KPIs, so we could query it from the external spreadsheet
without define any kind of logic, that could increase the complexity.\\

In short, elements defined are listed as follow:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A MySQL database with one table called Events used to store any possible
  event (previously defined the set of them)
  \item Few views used to achieve defined reports
  \item A Microsoft Excel spreadsheet used to show data returned by the views
  \item One connection per report used to connect Excel with the database
  via ODBC as data connectivity abstractor. 
\end{itemize}

You can see the relationship between above listed components on the 
\reffigure{f_excel_architecture}.

\end{figure}

\section{Database model}
Database model was defined as simple as possible, keeping in mind
possible normalization in the future without having a big impact on the data. So
decission was to use
\emph{Enum}\footnote{https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/enum.html} data
type for those fields that are static or with a predefined set of
elements like: country, project\_type or  type fields
(\reffigure{f_data_model}).

	\centering
   	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{./resources/data_model.png}
   	\caption{Data model}
   	\label{f_data_model}
\end{figure}

The most relevant field here is \emph{type}, where covers all required possible
scenarios in a project's lifetime that we needed to track. And base on that, 
reports (views) can show the specific information to be analyzed.

\section{Views definition and reports}
As described on the previous sections, we defined five reports, they are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Amount of launches, per country and month
  \item Total project's delay
  \item Project's delays in detail
  \item Gantt chart
  \item Project's timelines chart 
\end{itemize}

On top of them, we also added an extra report listing all project's events,
just for our reference.

You can see screenshots on how they look for each of them on
\reffigure{f_report_launches}, \reffigure{f_report_delays},
\reffigure{f_report_delays_detail}, \reffigure{f_report_gantt},
\reffigure{f_report_timelines} and \reffigure{f_report_events}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]

   	\label{f_report_delays}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[ht!]

   	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{./resources/report_delays_detail.png}
   	\caption{Detailed delays report}
   	\label{f_report_delays_detail}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
   	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{./resources/report_gantt.png}
   	\caption{Gantt report}
   	\label{f_report_gantt}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
   	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{./resources/report_timelines.png}
   	\caption{Timelines report}
   	\label{f_report_timelines}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
   	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{./resources/report_events.png}
   	\caption{Events report}
   	\label{f_report_events}
\end{figure}

Each of those reports has defined one or more than one table's view that execute
the required data calculations and format the output in a Excel friendly way, so
the spreadsheet just need to show it and doesn't require any customization. 

This data and format coupling on the views definition was done on purpose,
in order to be flexible enough in the future in case was needed to define a
different viewer component, a part of the Excel, such as and HTML, or just
migrate it to a different platform. But, on both case the model could remain
untouched if the objective remained the same and only is needed to change the
view with a more powerful or friendly one. See and example on
\ref{f_report_launchesbymonth}.

\lstinputlisting[language=SQL,breaklines=true,caption=Launches
by month
view,label=f_report_launchesbymonth,frame=single,captionpos=b]{resources/report_launchesbymonth.sql}

In the other hand, decoupling it will need to be taken sooner or later if
we want to have a flexible and scalable tool, but this will be part of the
future work.

\section{The issue and what to improve}
As slightly tackle on previous sections, building a reporting tool based on
Excel was not the better solution, but it covered the main needs, even if we
faced issues like slowness, a single shared spreadsheet to be used by all
project managers, every report has a standalone database connection with the
possible impact on resources it could have and manual database insert per
each project's event.

All these points will be reviewed and covered on the next chapter. 

\chapter{New RESTful architecture}
After few time working with the spreadsheet linked with the database, and having
listed its downsides, I have started thinking about how to improve it without
affecting the main objective \ref{t_main_objective} but making it more
user friendly.

We already had listed the weaknesses and thinking on one by one, just came up
that the main change would be to replace completly the view (Excel), that
will solve all the issues, but will lose the power of the pivot table and
filters, but it could be managed in a second or third stage.

Now the question is: what could be the best replacement?

\chapter{Conclusions}

\chapter{Future work}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Refactor database connectivity using a proper JPA based framework.
  
	Implement a real database connection pool using one of the existing persistence
	frameworks that implements JPA\footnote{Java Persistence API:
	\url{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javaee/jpa-137156.html}}.
	
	\item Remove data-format coupling returned to the client.
	\item Refactor client making it usable for the final user (requires assessment
	and evaluation of main actions to carry out by the user).
